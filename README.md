¿What is Autarium Institute?

Scientific knowledge and outer space are a human right. Lucrative objetives are a human right too. The individual or individual associatives must be empowered by the law to profit from their commercial agency based on their ecosystemic resources and knowledge. Ecosystemic resources and knowledge distribution must be left out to espontaneous individual and individuals associatives daily basis operations and planification in a lawfull and healthy framework. The responsability to offer a legal and operative market framework is a responsability that each individual and individual associatives must enact from their daily operative basis and not only from govermental policies and regulation, but the market must no be determined by private abusive lucrative policies enpowered by a deorganized market response justified by an enactment of the lucrative right that emanates from commercial law. For law empowerement and enforcement abuse is to be avoid in govermental agency, market empowerement and enforcement abuse is to be avoid in market agency and it is not a responsability only of govermental policies, the economic agency of individuals and individual associatives must operate on responsible market policies of their own as part of a healthy economical framework. For the individual or individuals associatives must have the right to enact their lucrative objetives and agencies, but the law must resctrict them if abuse of any part is committed, it must not shadowed the evidential thruths that are embodied in the legal and ethical corpus and constitution of their societies.

Intellectual scientific and tecnological property must be framework in a humanitarian knowledge and ecosystemic administration principles. Knowledge distribution must not be on the basis of: "let´s share what we do not need anymore and what we have drained out of their consequences in an intellectual, scientific and technological sense and even in a commercial and lucrative sense", as knowledge and productive activities, the basis for lucrative agency, are correlated, as goods and services must be based on knowledge to be competitive, including market and social knowledge. How can we expect the world to be competitive if the knowledge that make us competitive is kept apart from them? Knowledge secrecy and law protection of knowledge as an incentive is a positive feedback for ethical ignorance based agency, inclusively for scientific and technical communities, and part of a set of ilegal commitments and operations between govermental individuals and individual assocatives and abusive lucrative oriented individuals and individual associatives.

Outer space can not be privetized and commercialized if a humanitarian sense of law is to be preserved as well as scientific and technological knowledge must be kept accesible in their principles and only specific applications must be temporarily kept privative for lucrative agency. What would had happened if language or logic have intellectual property out from grammaticians or logicians? The ones who actually today benefit of their scientific intellectual property would have not build their essentials for lacking of resources. The same is happening to the world. How can our scientific methods be based on order perception and intellection if perception of the world, nature and outer space or universe has a price tag and intellection of the laws and models of them are corporative secrets, it is just unfair madness if not a crime against humanity. Future science needs humanitarian and posthumanitarian legal and ethical foundations.

Don´t let outer space be privatized and commercialize. Don´t let scientific and technical knowledge be kept secret in principles! We are not against lucrative oriented agency, on the contrary, we want competent individuals and individual associatives to enter on a competitive market balance and deploy a dynamic economy of smart transactions and oriented to add value to the individuals, individual associatives, goods and services, based on a reasonable knowledge production and distribution.

Autarium is an institute of open formal science and engineering. We want to empower the world, especially those left out of the first world equation,to use scientific and technological knowledge to thrive, learn and develop more scientific and technological knowledge and applications. We achieved these by publicating in CC License all our lierature, that comes out from a community of scientific and engineering students and graduates, as well as offering free licensed software and hardware for knowledge and application development education, promotion, production and distribution. We aim to open material and synthetic science and engineering, but materials and industrial synthesis processes are kept privative and out of proportion force is applied again those who are against this conventional based order. Open and free knowledge and technological society, humanity and posthumanitarian era is possible. Join us and realize a truth sense of existance for posterity.
